# Demonstration of emmy library protocols and schemes on Android

This repository contains an example Android application, which uses **[emmy](https://github.com/xlab-si/emmy)** library for *sigma
protocols* and *zero-knowledge proofs*. It demonstrates various examples of protocols and schemes supported
by *emmy*, including Pedersen commitment scheme, Schnorr protocol, Camenisch-Shoup verifiable encryption, 
and an improved **anonymous credential system** (also: *pseudonym system*) based on the work of Lysyanskaya [1].
